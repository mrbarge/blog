			<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The story so far</h2>
<p>In order to explore the origins and prevalence of a personally-beloved drum loop sample named <code>BRBEATLP.958</code>, I&rsquo;ve fingerprinted and catalogued every sample of every MOD/S3M/XM/IT file in the Mod Archive so that I can hunt it down amidst tens of thousands of different songs. Now it&rsquo;s time to see where this takes us.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../mods-1">Part one</a></li>
<li><a href="../mods-2">Part two</a></li>
<li><a href="../mods-3">Part three</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-songs-used-brbeatlp958">How many songs used <code>BRBEATLP.958</code>?</h2>
<p>I found fifty-four different songs which all used (or at least included) <code>BRBEATLP.958</code>, spread across all four file formats.</p>
<p>More interesting was actually seeing all the unique filenames that had been used to name the sample:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DL035.IFF</code></li>
<li><code>DRUMLOOP.AIF</code></li>
<li><code>RIFF11-1.SMP</code></li>
<li><code>1.wav</code></li>
<li><code>JUNGLE1.IFF</code></li>
</ul>
<p>to list but a few.</p>
<p>This then made me wonder..</p>
<h2 id="what-was-the-earliest-use-of-brbeatlp958">What was the earliest use of <code>BRBEATLP.958</code>?</h2>
<p>I, and I&rsquo;m sure many others, first heard this sample through the song <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&amp;query=55696">Point of Departure</a> by <a href="https://modarchive.org/member.php?69271">Necros</a>, because it was a very popular tracker song during the PC scene era.</p>
<p>But, given that the sample had been used by more than fifty songs and with a variety of different filenames, it got me wondering: which module file might&rsquo;ve been the first to use it?</p>
<p><em>Point of Departure</em> was released as part of the musicdisk <em>Progression</em>, which has a date of 22 July 1995 in its <code>file_id.diz</code>. So we&rsquo;d be looking for modules written before then.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint when many modules were released - especially <code>.MOD</code>s as they&rsquo;re typically the oldest. If there&rsquo;s nothing in the song&rsquo;s sample metadata, it&rsquo;s very difficult to ascertain a date unless a web search manages to provide any clue.</p>
<p>So, starting with the list of all .MOD files that used the <code>BRBEATLP.958</code> sample, I began to do some searching to see if I could find their individual release dates.</p>
<p>It was then that I discovered..</p>
<h2 id="someones-done-this-already-more-awesomely">Someone&rsquo;s done this already, more awesomely</h2>
<p>Searching for the release date of one specific .MOD, I eventually stumbled upon the <a href="https://modsamplemaster.thegang.nu/">.mod Sample Master</a> site, a fantastic resource where someone has catalogued each individual sample from the archive of .MOD files. We can indeed <a href="https://modsamplemaster.thegang.nu/sample.php?sha1=4ddfbca0d8f77b30c6578351eb1a5f1bc183b368">find <code>BRBEATLP.958</code> on this site</a>, under one of the alternate filenames of <code>DL035.IFF</code>, and through there we can see the list of <code>.MOD</code> files that use the same sample.</p>
<p>Finding this site was great, because it was further validation that my own efforts were correct (all the matches in my dataset were in this site&rsquo;s list!). And it didn&rsquo;t immediately render my existing efforts pointless, because the site is - presently, at least - solely focused on the <code>.MOD</code> format. But aside from all that, it also has one other fantastic feature - the <em>&ldquo;Similar Samples&rdquo;</em> section. This, as you can imagine, links to other samples which have a close similarity to the one presently being browsed.</p>
<p>Through that feature, I was able to discover <a href="https://modsamplemaster.thegang.nu/sample.php?sha1=52ac3dd508b8688fabd7715620522e127d586ca1">a different sample</a> - most commonly titled <code>sl2.brk.beat</code> - which was used in <em>many</em> more mods than the <code>BRBEATLP.958</code> sample. It had roughly 300 bytes difference (out of ~29400), but sounded almost indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Suddenly my focus shifted to this new sample and what discoveries it might bring.</p>
<h2 id="the-sl2brkbeat-connection">The <code>sl2.brk.beat</code> connection</h2>
<p>I immediately searched my dataset for any matches of the <code>sl2.brk.beat</code> sample hash. I found 56 additional modules that used that sample - 28 of which were non-<code>.MODs</code> - so now I was looking at more than 110 different songs that made use of <em>either</em> sample.</p>
<p>My goal was still the same: to find the earliest use of that sample I possibly could - but more-so, to hopefully find out something about that sample&rsquo;s origins at the same time.</p>
<p>Finding a precursor to <em>Point of Departure</em> came pretty quickly, with many of the <code>.MOD</code> files using the <code>sl2.brk.beat</code> sample having dates of 1993 or 1994 in their sample text.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the earliest use of the sample I could find was in the song &ldquo;<a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&amp;query=158504">Pandemonium</a>&rdquo; by <strong>Yaz</strong>, which several Internet sites pointed towards having a release date of 1992.</p>

</div>

<p>Later in this blog we&rsquo;ll cover some confirmation that this was indeed <em>the</em> earliest use of this sample in a .MOD file. With that question finally answered, it was time to determine the origin of the sample itself.</p>
<h2 id="a-sample-pack-diversion">A sample-pack diversion</h2>
<p>In my dataset, I&rsquo;d noticed that a couple of modules named the sample as <code>ST-31 sl2 brk.beat</code>. Anyone with a decent interest in the Amiga demoscene will recognize the meaning of the <code>ST-XX</code> prefix - it indicates a particular SoundTracker sample pack, collections of which used to be distributed between Amiga tracking enthusiasts back in the day. The first, <code>ST-01</code>, was created by Karsten Obarski (<a href="../mods-2">remember him?</a>) and came bundled with The Ultimate SoundTracker. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://chipflip.wordpress.com/2017/02/13/obarski/">nice article</a> I found on that. You can also download <a href="https://archive.org/details/AmigaSTXX">the entire ST-XX collection</a> from Archive.org.</p>
<p>So, was <code>BRBEATLP.958</code>/<code>sl2.brk.beat</code> indeed a part of one of these sample packs, and could that be its origin?</p>
<p>Well, to be absolutely sure, I went and listened to every single sample with a filesize between 25000 and 35000 bytes in that Internet Archive mirror, and no.. it was not any of them. I will note, however, that doing this was such an incredible nostalgic flashback. Only with a true relic of the 1990s could you possibly experience the sonic dissonance of two seconds of an Iron Maiden guitar solo followed by a radio jingle for &lsquo;Stereo FM&rsquo; followed by the sound of a laughing baby. I think it would be an <em>awesome</em> project to build a new song nowadays using just the samples in these packs.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This quest was beginning to look like a lost cause, and then, suddenly..</p>
<h2 id="the-answer-was-right-there">The answer was right there</h2>
<p>Searching on variations of the filename <code>sl2.brk.beat</code> eventually clued me in to the existence of a British breakbeat rave group whose name was.. would you believe it.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL2_(group)">SL2</a>.</p>
<p>I spent an <em>extremely</em> enjoyable half an hour listening through the SL2 discography circa 1989-1992 (which one of the group&rsquo;s members had only very recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/thedjslipmatt/videos">uploaded to YouTube</a>). I heard several breaks that <em>could</em> have been <code>BRBEATLP.958</code>, but I wasn&rsquo;t completely sure until I landed upon the song &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT1KLE5gS4">The Noise</a>&rdquo;..</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHT1KLE5gS4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>.. and, right at the 1m11s mark, there it was. Undeniably the beat I&rsquo;d been looking for this whole time. Attached to a thoroughly excellent tune, might I add.</p>
<p>As if I needed any other reassurance, I would later also find the StackExchange thread &ldquo;<a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15812/how-did-musicians-acquire-samples-for-tracker-music-mod-s3m-xm-and-the-like">How did musicians acquire samples for tracker music?</a>&rdquo; where none other than Yaz himself (creator of Pandemonium) <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15812/how-did-musicians-acquire-samples-for-tracker-music-mod-s3m-xm-and-the-like#comment53013_15814">commented</a> on the origins of the samples for that track:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We swapped sample disks by post (not many folks had modems then apart from crackers/traders) or we sampled our own from synths or we used sounds from other mods. We also sampled from records from the time (I sampled from the b-side of an SL2 rave track for example for my Pandemonium mod)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So: the sample was created directly from the SL2 record by Yaz and used in his track <em>Pandemonium</em>, and subsequently spread out from there. The only unknown is how/why the sample slightly changed from <code>sl2.brk.beat</code> to <code>BRBEATLP.958</code> - it&rsquo;s entirely possible someone else may have re-sampled the same beat. For my part, I&rsquo;m happy enough to leave that loose end hanging.</p>
<h2 id="some-thanks">Some thanks</h2>
<p>This whole dumb endeavour wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://modarchive.org/">The Mod Archive</a>, for its part in digital preservation of tracking music.</li>
<li><a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> for helping keep the scene alive for musicians young and old, and doing so in an opensource way. I wouldn&rsquo;t have tackled the .IT format without it.</li>
<li><a href="https://modsamplemaster.thegang.nu/">The Mod Sample Master</a>, truly an awesome site, without which I may not have made the sample leap I needed to make.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org">The Internet Archive</a>, which plays such a <em>vital</em> role in preserving the history of an Internet which is so difficult to find anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>They all deserve a big, unknowing thank you.</p>
<h2 id="until-next-time">Until next time..?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve arrived at the end of this adventure, but there&rsquo;s room for at least one epilogue. Since I gathered data across all samples in the Mod Archive, we may as well use it for more than just <code>BRBEATLP</code>. In the concluding entry of this series, we&rsquo;ll take some fun excursions through the data and see what interesting things we can find. Like, for instance, what&rsquo;s the most frequently used sample of all time? What&rsquo;s the biggest sample used in a song? And just how many samples have the word &lsquo;poop&rsquo; in their name?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll write up that entry, but I hope it won&rsquo;t take quite as long as this one. Until then, thank you for reading.</p>
