      <description>Goodness, how time flies.. two years have gone by since my last blog CKS-related post, enough time for my existing certification to expire.. so I guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to dust off the ol&amp;rsquo; Hugo template and write about it again! I recently re-upped my Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist certification in February, and also got the opportunity to beta-test the 2025 revision of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator one as well. How have things changed for both of these since then?</description>

      <title>Taking the CKS Kubernetes Security Specialist certification in 2023</title>

      <description>Some time ago, I wrote a post about my experiences studying for and undertaking the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist exam. Well, the two year validity period for that certification expired for me this past week, and since I’m still floating through the world of Kubernetes in my daily job, I figured I’d attempt to re-acquire it.&#xA;Now that I’m on the tail-end of that experience with the certification back under my belt for another two years, it feels like a good opportunity to revisit this topic and provide some pointers for anyone looking to take (or re-take) the plunge themselves.</description>

      <description>Having just passed the exam myself, I wanted to do a write-up whilst many of these thoughts are fresh in my mind. Disclaimer: opinions are my own, not my employer&amp;rsquo;s, etc.&#xA;What is it? The Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) is a certification course offered by the Linux Foundation. It builds on the skills required by the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification with a focus on Kubernetes and cloud security. It’s a relatively new certification, having been released in November 2020, and requires the practitioner to firstly hold an active CKA certification.</description>

      <description>In this blog we&amp;rsquo;re going to learn how we can use kubectl&amp;rsquo;s patch command to modify the configuration of Kubernetes-managed resources via the command-line. Before we do that though, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through a quick primer on how you can display Kubernetes resources so that you know what and where to patch.&#xA;Getting Kuberenetes resources One of the first kubectl commands a Kubernetes beginner will become intimately acquainted with is the get command.</description>
